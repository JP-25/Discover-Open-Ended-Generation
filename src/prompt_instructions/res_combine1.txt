Please take the list of summarized traits or concept phrases below for {[[D1]]}, and break or decompose each into the most fine-grained, distinct, meaningful components possible.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Break down each phrase only if it contains two or more distinct and independently meaningful concepts that can stand on their own. A phrase should be split if it describes:
- an action or identity combined with a role or context (e.g., "competitor on debate teams" to "competitor"; "debate teams")
- multiple descriptors joined in a single phrase (e.g., "confident public speaker" to "confident"; "public speaker")

Do NOT split a phrase if doing so would break or obscure the full semantic meaning, especially when:
- The meaning depends on functional, contextual, or descriptive modifiers (e.g., "engages audience effectively" should remain as-is)
- The full phrase describes a specific behavior or pattern that loses clarity when broken up (e.g., "takes initiative in engaging peers outside arts classes" should stay intact)

Prioritize semantic clarity over grammatical or structural cues. Only split when you're confident that each component still conveys a clear and distinct idea on its own. If splitting a phrase would break its meaning, keep it as one unit.

Your answer structure should strictly follow '[[D1]]: <lists of phrases>' (IMPORTANT: for <lists of phrases>, should be separated by a semicolon (;). DO NOT ADD any extra headers, information, and explanations.)
