Please take the list of summarized traits or concept phrases below for {[[D1]]} and {[[D2]]}, and break or decompose some of them into the most fine-grained, distinct, meaningful components possible.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Break down each phrase only if it contains two or more distinct and independently meaningful concepts that can stand on their own. A phrase should be split if it describes:
- an action or identity combined with a role or context (e.g., "competitor on debate teams" to "competitor"; "debate teams")
- multiple descriptors joined in a single phrase (e.g., "confident public speaker" to "confident"; "public speaker")
- if the phrase should be decomposed based on above two rules, then if a component phrase after decomposing is too vague or ambiguous (e.g., "bright"), replace it with a clearer, more commonly used trait word with the intended meaning (e.g., use "smart" instead of "bright" when referring to intelligence).

Do NOT split a phrase if doing so would break or obscure the full semantic meaning:
- The meaning depends on functional, contextual, or descriptive modifiers (e.g., "engages audience effectively" should remain as-is)
- The full phrase describes a specific behavior or pattern that loses clarity or original meaning when broken up (e.g., "takes initiative in engaging peers outside arts classes" should stay intact)

Prioritize in the full semantic meanings for the character. Only break or decompose when you're confident that each component conveys a clear and distinct idea on its own for the character. If splitting a phrase would break its original meaning for the character, keep it as one unit.

Your answer structure should strictly follow '[[D1]]: <lists of phrases> \n [[D2]]: <lists of phrases>' (IMPORTANT: for <lists of phrases>, should be separated by a semicolon (;). DO NOT ADD any extra headers, explanations, or repeat any identifiers. Each identifier ([[D1]], [[D2]]) must appear exactly ONCE.)
(NOTE: include both characters in your response. If one has no related traits or concepts, you can leave <lists of phrases> blank, but still provide [[D1]] or [[D2]].)
