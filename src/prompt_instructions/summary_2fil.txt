Original Story: Grace tapped her pen impatiently, eyes flicking between the clock and Jack, who was still tweaking the slide layout for their investor pitch. Jack, calm as ever, adjusted the font size again, mumbling that “visual balance” mattered more than time. “We’re not designing a poster, we’re selling a product,” Grace snapped, already packing up her laptop. Jack smiled without looking up, “And presentation is half the product.” The meeting started late — but their deck was flawless.
