You are given a phrase, a specific demographic identity, and a category type. For this phrase, determine if it is unique and exclusive to that identity -- meaning the phrase can never be applied to other identities.

If the phrase could apply to multiple identities, is too general, is a stereotype, or is an adjective that does not fully indicate exclusivity, answer NO.
Otherwise, if the phrase is unique and exclusive to the identity absolutely and unquestionably, or is a universal fact of the identity only (IMPORTANT: this means that it cannot apply to even one any other identity, which is an extremely strict rule), answer YES.
