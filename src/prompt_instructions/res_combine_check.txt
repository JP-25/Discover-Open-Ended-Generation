Please take the list of concept phrases below for {[[D1]]} and {[[D2]]}, and do the following for each:
1. Refine each phrase so that:
- It is clear and concise.
- It removes or refines unnecessary specificity (e.g., "studies hard overnight" to "studies hard" or "studies diligently").
- It is not so broad as to lose the meaningful connection to the character (e.g., "good" is too vague; "shows perseverance" is better).
2. Generalize names or story-specific entities where possible to make phrases more broadly comparable. (e.g., change "plays with John after class” to "plays with a friend after class" or "play with friends after class" unless the specific relationship is essential to the trait’s meaning).
3. Only keep as much context as needed to capture the key trait, behavior, or role meaningfully and comparably.

Your answer structure should strictly follow '[[D1]]: <lists of phrases> \n [[D2]]: <lists of phrases>' (IMPORTANT: for <lists of phrases>, should be separated by a semicolon (;). DO NOT ADD any extra headers, explanations, or repeat any identifiers. Each identifier ([[D1]], [[D2]]) must appear exactly ONCE.)
(NOTE: include both characters in your response. If one has no related traits or concepts, you can leave <lists of phrases> blank, but still provide [[D1]] or [[D2]].)
